# Appointment Scheduler in Java

The program should ideally be able to add, query, and delete from an array. 


# Overview



This is a program to develop my skills in Java as well as general programming. The purpose of the program is to be able to create, keep, and delete appointments all in an array.

# Results



The most challenging part of this assignment was by far dealing with the array. I was unable to query from and delete from the array based on user input. I can add appointments to an array, but I couldn't find a solution to query from the array to be able to retrieve, edit, or delete the individual appointments. 

# Development Environment

I used Java in Visual Studio Code


# Useful Websites


# Future Work

This project could be improved by having a fully functioning way to add, remove, and delete appointments. Additionally, the appointments that already exist should be integrated with a calendar, that can then tell the use which appointments are available to be booked. As of now, the date is just a string which isn't even converted into a date.

User can make an appointment, which gets passed into an array. However, there is no loop to manage user input, and there is also no way to query data from the array. More work is needed.

There is now user input validation for firstname. However, implementing it for all of the user inputs proved to be more difficult than a simple copy paste. I ran into errors making identical while loops for each of the inputs.
